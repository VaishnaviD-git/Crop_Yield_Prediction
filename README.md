Crop Yield Prediction (End-to-End ML Project)

This project focuses on predicting crop yield using machine learning techniques to support farmers, researchers, and policymakers in making data-driven agricultural decisions.

ðŸš€ Features

Data Preprocessing & Cleaning â€“ handled missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ visualized trends across crops, seasons, and regions.

Machine Learning Models â€“ implemented and compared algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) for accurate yield prediction.

Model Evaluation â€“ used metrics like RÂ², MAE, RMSE for performance comparison.


ðŸ“‚ Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Machine Learning (Regression & Ensemble models)

Git & GitHub (version control & repo management)

ðŸŽ¯ Outcomes

Provides insights into crop yield trends based on historical data.

Helps in better planning for agriculture & resource management.

Can be extended with real-time datasets and IoT/remote sensing data for practical field use.
